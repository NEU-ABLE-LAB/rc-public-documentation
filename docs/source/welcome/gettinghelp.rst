Getting Help
************

You can get help from the Research Computing team by sending an email,
submitting a ticket on ServiceNow, or making an appointment to meet with one of
our staff members through our Bookings page.

Email
=====

You can email the Research Computing team at rchelp@northeastern.edu.
This will automatically generate a ticket for you in ServiceNow.
Make sure to include details about your question or issue, including any commands
or scripts that you are trying to use, so that we can best connect you with the right person to help you.

ServiceNow
==========

You can submit a ticket on ServiceNow by selecting from the Research Computing ServiceNow catalog https://northeastern.service-now.com/research?id=nurc_category.
You might need to sign in with your myNortheastern username and password to view the ServiceNow catalog page.

Consultations (in person and online)
====================================

We offer scheduled consultation hours at the Snell Library most weekdays
during normal business hours (9AM to 5PM). Note that we follow the Northeastern University
holiday schedule, so there are no walk-in hours on holidays or during breaks.
