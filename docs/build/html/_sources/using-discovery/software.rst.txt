Installing Software
********************

There are a few ways you can install software for your own use on Discovery. You should always first
check to see if the software package that you need is already available through one of the preinstalled
modules on Discovery. See :ref:`using_module` for how to view and load software modules to your path.

If you have a software request or need help with installing a software package, please submit a ServiceNow
software request ticket. Be aware that there might be packages that cannot be installed on Discovery due
to incompatibility with the hardware on Discovery.

We recommend that you try using Spack https://spack.io/_ to install software locally to your path.
