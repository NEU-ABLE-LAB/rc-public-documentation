Using Globus
************

Globus is a data management system that you can use to transfer and share files.
Northeastern has a subscription to Globus, and you can setup a Globus account with
your myNortheastern credentials. If you have another account, either personal or
through another institution, you can also link your accounts.

Globus Account Set Up
======================

Use the following instructions to setup an account with Globus using your myNortheastern credentials.

1. Go to `Globus <https://www.globus.org>`_.
2. Click Log In.
3. From the Use your existing organizational login, select Northeastern University, and then click Continue.
4. Enter your myNortheastern username and password.
5. If you do not have a previous Globus account, click Continue. If you have a previous account, click Link to existing account.
6. Check the agreement checkbox, and then click Continue.
7. Click Allow to give Globus permissions to access your files.

You will then be able to access the `Globus File Manager app <https://app.globus.org>`_.

.. note::
  If you received an account identity that includes your NUID number
  (for example 000123456@northeastern.edu), you can follow the “Creating and linking
  a new account identity” instructions below to get a different account identity if
  you want a more user-friendly account identity. You can then link the two accounts together.
