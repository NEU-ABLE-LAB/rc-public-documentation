Using Discovery with your class FAQ
***********************************
There are several use cases for teaching and learning with the Discovery cluster in a classroom.
Discovery offers both a command line and web interface, allowing flexibility in access and instruction level.
Using Discovery gives you and your students access to many popular scientific applications,
and also allows you and your students to install other packages as needed.
The easy-to-use Open onDemand web portal also offers a built-in visual file
explorer for file viewing and transfer.

The following Frequently Asked Questions section should help to answer most of your questions about how you can
use the Discovery cluster for classroom use. You can also reach out to us at rchelp@northeastern.edu or submit
a ServiceNow ticket if you need further information.

**How can I use Discovery with my class?**

There are several ways you can use Discovery in your classroom. You class can use Discovery for accessing
specific software packages and working environments, as well as learn how to utilize high performance computing (HPC) resources for
large and complex data processing, such as Machine Learning, AI and Molecular Simulations and more.

**Do my students have to learn Linux to work with Discovery?**

Depending on your class assignments, many students can work with the Open onDemand web portal, which
does not require any knowledge of Linux to use. In cases where you want them to work on the command line,
they should have a basic understanding of Linux commands. Please see the question "Is there any training on Discovery for my class" below if
you would like us to provide your class with a basic training course prior to using Discovery.

**What software is available to use with my class on Discovery?**

There are many software packages available, including popular software apps such as Jupyter Notebook, Rstudio, and Matlab.
If you have an account on Discovery, you can see the list of available software by using the ``module avail`` command. See :ref:`using_module` for more information.
Students have access to all of the modules on Discovery. They can also use the interactive apps available on Open onDemand. See :ref:`using_ood` for more information.
We can also install additional modules and libraries specifically for your class as needed.

**How do I get my class access to Discovery?**

We need a list of your students' names and emails, and we will create accounts for them.
An easy way to get a list of student emails is in Blackboard.

1. In Blackboard, click Course Tools > Student Email Addresses.
2. Click Spreadsheet.
3. Select Open with Microsoft Excel, and click OK.
4. In the spreadsheet that opens, select the emails and course number/section (CRN) of the course that you want to work on Discovery.
   Note: The spreadsheet contains the student emails of all of your active courses, so only select the emails of the students who need access.

Send the list of student names and emails to rchelp@northeastern.edu along with your name, your course name, number, and dates the course is running.
Please also include a list any software not currently available that needs to be installed.

**Is there any training on Discovery for my class?**

Yes, we can provide in-classroom training, either in person or in an online webinar format, for your class on using Discovery. We can customize it to
focus on the resources you will be using with them for the class.
